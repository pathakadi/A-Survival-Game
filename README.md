# A-Survival-Game

A Project from MDG Problem Statement in which we have to Develop a survival-based runner game that utilizes an external food API to enable players to gain energy and continue running. The game will start with the player having a certain amount of energy in the form of calories, which will decrease as the player runs. The main goal of the game is to survive as long as possible by collecting food items that appear on the screen. The game will use images of various food items from the API as pickups and calorie values to determine the energy gained by the player. Additionally, if the player consumes more calories than a certain threshold, the player's speed will decrease, making it harder to collect food items and progress further in the game.

I have done this project using HTML , CSS and JavaScript and by fetching external API from RapidAPI.
